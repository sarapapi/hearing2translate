{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 5, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So on the left hand side, we can see if we give some samples with just questions and answers, we may not be able to obtain the correct answers"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 6, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But if we give some more reasoning description, the model is able to predict the reasoning description and also make a correct prediction here"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 7, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So it is good to have interpretable multi-step reasoning as output."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 8, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we also think method problem is a straightforward application to evaluate such reasoning abilities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 9, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here in our problem setup, given the questions, we need to solve this question and obtain the numerical answers."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 10, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in our data sets, we are also given the mathematical expression, which leads to this particular answer as well."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 11, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So certain assumptions also apply as in previous work."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 12, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "we assume the precision of quantities are known"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 13, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we only consider basic operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponential."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 14, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Furthermore, complicated operators can be actually decomposed into these basic operators."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 15, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So previous work in method problem solving actually can categorize into sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-tree model."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 16, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So traditional sequence-to-sequence model convert the expression to a specific sequence for generation."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 17, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And it is pretty easy to implement, and it can generalize to many different complicated problems."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 18, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But the drawbacks of the performance is actually generally not better than the structured model And it is lack of the interpretability for prediction"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 19, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But actually this direction is still quite popular because of the transformer model."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 20, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in tree-based models, we actually structure these expressions in the tree form and follow a pre-order traversal in tree generations."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 21, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here we keep generating the operators until we reach the leaves, which are the quantities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 22, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here the good thing is that it actually gives us this binary tree structure. But actually it is quite counterintuitive because we generate the operator first, and then at the end we generate the quantities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 23, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And the second thing is that it also contains some repetitive computations."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 24, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here if we look at this expression, 8 times 3 plus 3 is actually generated twice. But in fact, we should reuse the results."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 25, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in our proposed approach, we want to solve those problems in a step-by-step and interpretable manner."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 26, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So, for example, here in the second step, we can obtain this divisor, which is 27."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 27, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "we can also refer back to the original questions to find the relevant contents."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 28, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And in these steps, we obtain the divisors."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 29, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So and then at this third step, we actually get the quotient."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 30, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Alright, and after these three steps, we can actually use the results from the second step and then get the results of the fourth step. And then finally we can obtain the dividends."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 31, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here we actually generate the whole expression directly rather than generating a single operators or quantities."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 32, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So this makes the process more accurate."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 33, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in our deductive system, we first start with a bunch of quantities presented in the questions, and also including some constants as our initial state."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 34, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the expression is represented by EIJOP."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 35, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "where we perform operator from QI to QJ, and such expression is actually directed."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 36, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we also have subtraction reverse here to represent the opposite direction."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 37, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This is quite similar to relation extraction."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 38, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in a formal deductive system, at the time step t, we apply the operator between the qi and qj pair, and then we obtain these new expressions."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 39, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "we add it to the next state to become a new quantity."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 40, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So this slide actually visualizes the evolution of the state where we keep adding expression to the current state."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 41, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in our model implementations, we first use a pre-trained language model which can be Brits or Robertas, and then we encode a sentence, and then we obtain these quantity representations."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 42, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So once we get the quantity representations, we can start to do inference."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 43, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Here we show an example of Q1 to obtain the representation for Q1 divided by Q2 and then times Q4."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 44, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "First, we get the pair representation, which is basically just the concatenation between Q1 and Q2. And then we apply a feedforward network, which is parameterized by the operator."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 45, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And then finally we obtain the expression representation Q1 divided by Q2"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 46, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But in fact, in practice, in the inference stage, we might be able to get the incorrect expression as well."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 47, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here all the possible expression is equal to 3 times the number of operators."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 48, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the nice thing here is that we can easily add constraints to control this search space."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 49, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "For example, if this expression is not allowed, we can simply remove this expression in our search space"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 50, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in the second step, we do the same thing, but the only difference is one more quantity."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 51, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This quantity comes from the previous calculated expression."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 52, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So finally we can obtain this final expression Q"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 53, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "times Q4. And we can also see the number of all the possible expressions is different from the previous step."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 54, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So such difference make it hard to apply beam search because the probability distribution between these two steps is unbalanced."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 55, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So the training procedure is similar to training a sequence-to-sequence model, where we optimize the loss at each time step."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 56, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And here we also use this tau to represent when we should terminate this generation process."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 57, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And here the space is different from sequence to sequence because the space is different at each time step while in traditional sequence to sequence model, it is the number of vocabulary."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 58, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And it also allows us to impose certain constraints from prior knowledge."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 59, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we conduct experiments on the commonly used method problem datasets MAWPS, MAT23K, MATQA, and SWAMP"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 60, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And here we briefly show the results compared with the previous batch approaches."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 61, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So our best performing variant is Robeta Dictative Reasoner."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 62, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "and in fact we do not use beam search in contrast obvious approaches using beam search"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 63, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Alright, so the best approaches are often tree-based model"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 64, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So overall, our reasoner is able to significantly outperform this tree-based model"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 65, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But we can see the absolute number on Mathqa or SWAM are not really high."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 66, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we further investigate the results on"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 67, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And this dataset is challenging because the author tried to manually adding something to confuse the NLP model, such as adding irrelevant information and extra quantities"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 68, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So in our prediction, we find some of the intermediate values are actually negatives."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 69, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "For example, in these questions, we are asking how many apples does Drake have?"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 70, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But we have some extra information like 17 fewer pitches And Steven has 8 pitches, which is totally irrelevant"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 71, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So our model makes some prediction like this, which is producing negative values."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 72, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "and we observe these two expressions"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 73, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we can actually limit this search space by removing those results are negative so that we can make the answer correct."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 74, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we further find such constraint actually improves quite a lot for some models."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 75, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "For example, for birds, we improved seven points. And then for the Robeta-based model, we actually improved two points."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 76, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So better language model has a better language understanding ability so that the number here is higher for Robita and lower for Bird."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 77, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we also try to analyze the difficulty behind this"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 78, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "we assume the number of unused quantities can be regarded as irrelevant information here."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 79, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here we can see that we have the percentage of samples with unused quantities, and the SWAMP dataset has the largest proportion."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 80, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And here we also show the overall performance."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 81, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "for those samples without unused quantities. So the overall performance is actually higher than the overall performance."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 83, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "performance. For MAWPS, we don't really have too many disk cases, so I just ignore this part."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 84, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So finally, we want to show the interpretability through a crash and perturbation example."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 85, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here our model actually makes a wrong prediction at the first step."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 86, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we can actually correlate this expression with the sentence here."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 87, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we think this sentence might be misleading the model to an incorrect prediction."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 88, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So here, printing another 35 makes the model think it should be an addition operator."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 89, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we try to revise the sentence to be something like the number of pear trees are 55 fewer than the apple trees"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 90, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So we make it to convey more accurate semantics such that the model is able to make the prediction correct."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 91, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So this study shows how the interpretable predictions help us understand the model behavior."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 92, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "So to conclude our work, so first our model is actually pretty efficient."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 93, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we are able to provide interpretable solving procedure."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 94, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "and we can easily incorporate some prior knowledge as constraint which can help improve the performance"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 95, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And the last thing is that the underlying mechanism does not only apply to Mapwork problem solving tasks, but also other tasks that involve multi-step reasoning."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 96, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "But we also have certain limitations"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 97, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "if we have a large number of operators or constants, the memory consumption could be pretty high."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 98, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And the second thing is that, as mentioned, because the probability distribution is unbalanced at different time steps, so it's also pretty challenging to apply beam search"}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 172, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "First, the corpus of article is limited to those collected from the 32 considered Belgian codes, which does not cover the entire Belgian law, as articles from decrees, directives and ordinances are missing."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 173, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "During the dataset construction, all references to these uncollected articles are ignored, which causes some question to end up with only a fraction of the initial number of relevant articles."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 174, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This information loss implies that the answer contained in the remaining relevant articles might be incomplete, although it's still completely appropriate."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 175, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Second, we should note that not all legal questions can be answered with statutes alone."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 178, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Instead, the landlord should probably rely more on case law and find precedents similar to their current situation."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 179, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "For example, the tenant makes two parties a week until 2am"}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 180, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Hence, some questions are better suited than others to the statutory article retrieval task, and the domain of the less suitable ones remains to be determined."}

{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 199, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we do these phrase alterations by focusing on six specific pieces, such as existence, plurality, counting, spatial relations, actions, and entity coreference, where each piece can consist of one or more instruments, in case we found more than one interesting way to create FOIL instances."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 200, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "For example, in the case of the actions piece, we have two instruments, one in which the action verb is changed with a different action and one in which actents are swapped."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 201, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "Counting and coreference also are pieces that have more than one instrument."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 202, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "And we create these foils by making sure that they fail to describe the image, that they are grammatical and otherwise valid sentences."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 203, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "This is not easy to do, because a foiled caption may be less likely than the original caption."}
{"dataset_id": "acl_6060", "sample_id": 204, "src_lang": "en", "tgt_lang": "en", "output": "For example, though it's not impossible, it is statistically less likely for plants to cut a man than a man to cut plants, and large vision and language models could pick up on this."}
