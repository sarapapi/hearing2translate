  Hearing to Translate: The Effectiveness of Speech Modality Integration into LLMs
</h2>

The **Hearing-to-Translate** test suite provides a unified evaluation framework for assessing how effectively SpeechLLMs, Speech Foundation Models (SFMs), and cascaded ASR→LLM pipelines handle speech-to-text translation across diverse real-world conditions. Covering 21 systems, 13 language pairs, 9 speech phenomena, and 16 benchmarks, the suite measures performance on clean speech as well as challenging scenarios involving gender bias, accents, code-switching, disfluencies, noise, named entities, emotion, and long-form content.

## Installation

Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sarapapi/hearing2translate.git
cd hearing2translate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
**Note:** The required `transformers` version depends on the specific model being used. 
Please ensure that you install the version compatible with the model you intend to run, as reported in [Table 6 of the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16378).

## Usage

### 1. Download benchmarks and set data directory
Download the desired benchmarks by following the instructions provided in each benchmark-specific README, 
and set `${H2T_DATADIR}` to the directory containing the corresponding audio files.

**Supported benchmarks by category:**
- **Generic**: [`fleurs`](manifests/fleurs/README.md), [`covost2`](manifests/covost2/README.md), [`europarl_st`](manifests/europarl_st/README.md), [`wmt`](manifests/wmt/README.md)
- **Gender Bias**: [`winoST`](manifests/winoST/README.md)
- **Accents**: [`commonAccent`](manifests/commonAccent/README.md), [`mandi`](manifests/mandi/README.md)
- **Code Switching**: [`cs-dialogue`](manifests/cs-dialogue/README.md), [`cs_fleurs`](manifests/cs_fleurs/README.md)
- **Disfluencies**: [`libristutter`](manifests/libristutter/README.md)
- **Noise**: [`noisy_fleurs_ambient`](manifests/noisy_fleurs_ambient/README.md), [`noisy_fleurs_babble`](manifests/noisy_fleurs_babble/README.md)
- **Emotion**: [`emotiontalk`](manifests/emotiontalk/README.md), [`mexpresso`](manifests/mexpresso/README.md)
- **Long-Form**: [`acl6060-long`](manifests/acl6060-long/README.md), [`acl6060-short`](manifests/acl6060-short/README.md), [`mcif-long`](manifests/mcif-long/README.md), [`mcif-short`](manifests/mcif-short/README.md)

### 2. Run inference

Run inference with the following command:
  ```python
  python infer.py \
    --model ${MODEL_NAME} \
    --in-modality {speech/text} \
    --in-file ./manifests/${BENCHMARK_NAME}/${SRC_LANG}-${TGT-LANG}.jsonl \
    --out-file ${OUTPUT_PATH}
  ```
The full list of supported models can be obtained with `python infer.py -h`.
Supported benchmarks are listed above, while benchmark-specific language coverage is documented in the corresponding READMEs.

### 3. Run evaluation

After generating model outputs, run the evaluation suite using the scripts in the `evaluation/` directory.
For environment setup, model downloads, and benchmark-specific evaluation commands, refer to the dedicated [Evaluation README](evaluation/README.md).

## Contributing

If you want to add a model to the repository, please create a PR with:
- the inference code in `inference/{llm/sfm/speechllm}`
- the outputs on all the applicable benchmarks of the test suite in `outputs/${MODEL_NAME}`

Please refer to [PR template](pull_request_template.md) for more information.
